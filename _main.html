<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Efficient set-up</h1>
<p>An efficient computer set-up is analogous to a well-tuned vehicle: its components work in harmony, it is well-serviced, and it is fast. This chapter describes the software set-up decisions that will enable a productive workflow, with an emphasis on the operating system and R set-up files that are used each time R loads. The next chapter deals with the hardware set-up. By the end of this chapter you will understand how to optimize your system to maximise the efficiency of your R programming. The topics we will cover include:</p>
<ul>
<li>R and operating systems: Windows, Mac or Linux? What’s the ‘system state’?</li>
<li>R version: how to keep your base R installation and packages up to date;</li>
<li>R startup: how and why to adjust your <code>.Rprofile</code> and <code>.Renviron</code> files;</li>
<li>RStudio: an integrated development environment (IDE) to boost your programming productivity;</li>
<li>BLAS and alternative R interpreters: looks at ways to make R faster.</li>
</ul>
<div id="operating-system" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Operating system</h2>
<p>R works on all three major operating systems (OSs): Linux, Mac and Windows. R is predominantly platform-independent, meaning that it should behave in the same way on each of these platforms. This is partly facilitated by CRAN tests which ensure that R packages work in all major operating systems. There are some operating system specific quirks that may influence the choice of OS and how it is set-up for R programming in the long-term.</p>
<div id="operating-system-and-resource-monitoring" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Operating system and resource monitoring</h3>
<p>R is mostly platform independent, working equally well on Windows, Linux and Mac. Minor differences aside,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> R is equally efficent across different operating systems. Likewise, the same optimisation techniques will work equally well on different OSs. Beyond the <span class="math">\(32\)</span> vs <span class="math">\(64\)</span> bit issue (covered in the next chapter), the main issue for many will be user friendliness and compatibility other programs used alongside R for work. Changing operating system can be a time consuming and <em>inefficient</em> process. Unless switching OSs for educational reasons, that could boost productivity in the longer term, our advice to stick to whatever OS you are most comfortable with.</p>
<p>Some packages (e.g. those that must be compiled and that depend on external libraries) are best installed at the operating system level (i.e. not using <code>install.packages</code>) on Linux systems. On Debian-based operating systems such as Ubuntu, these are named with the prefix <code>r-cran-</code> (see <a href="#deps">Section 2.4</a>).</p>
<p>Regardless of your operating system, it is good practice to track how system resources (primarily CPU and RAM use) respond when running time-consuming tasks. Alongside R profiling functions such as <code>profvis</code> (see Section <strong>XXX</strong>), system monitoring can help identify performance bottlenecks and opportunities for making tasks run faster.</p>
<p>A common use case for system monitoring of R processes is to identify how much RAM is being used and whether more is needed (covered in Chapter 3). System monitors also report the percentage of CPU resource allocated over time. On modern multi-threaded CPUs, many tasks will use only a fraction of the available CPU resource because R is by default a single-threaded program (see Chapter 6 on parallel programming). Monitoring CPU load in this context can be useful for identifying whether R is running in parallel (see Figure 2-1).</p>

</div>
<p>Figure 2-1. Output from a system monitor (<code>gnome-system-monitor</code> running on Ubuntu) showing the resources consumed by running the code presented in the second of the Exercises at the end of this section. The first increases RAM use, the second is single-threaded and the third is multi-threaded.</p>
<p>System monitoring is a complex topic that spills over into system administration and server management. Fortunately there are many tools designed to ease monitoring all major operating systems.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Linux, the shell command <code>top</code> displays key resource use figures for most distributions. <code>htop</code> and Gnome’s <strong>System Monitor</strong> (<code>gnome-system-monitor</code>, see Figure 2-1) are more refined alternatives which use command-line and graphical user interfaces respectively. A number of options such as <code>nethogs</code> monitor internet usage.</li>
<li>On Windows the <strong>Task Manager</strong> provides key information on RAM and CPU use by process. This can be started in modern Windows versions by typing <code>Ctl-Alt-Del</code> or by clicking the task bar and ‘Start Task Manager’.</li>
<li>On Mac the <strong>Activity Monitor</strong> provides similar functionality. This can be initiated form the Utilities folder in Launchpad.</li>

<div id="r-version" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> R version</h2>
<p>It is important to keep your R installation and packages up-to-date. This section explains how.</p>
<div id="installing-r" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Installing R</h3>
<p>The method of installing R varies for Windows, Linux and Mac.</p>
<p>On Windows, a single <code>.exe</code> file (hosted at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/</a>) will install the base R package.</p>
<p>On a Mac, the latest version should be installed by downloading the <code>.pkg</code> files hosted at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/</a>.</p>
<p>On Debian-based systems adding the CRAN repository in the format. To add the RStudio mirror for Ubuntu 14.04 (codenamed Trusty), for example, add the following line to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>:</p>
<pre><code>echo &#39;deb https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty`</code></pre>
<p>In the above code <code>cran.rstudio.com</code> is the mirror and <code>trusty</code> is the Ubuntu version. Then <code>r-base</code> and other <code>r-</code> packages can be installed. R also works on FreeBSD and other Unix-based systems.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Once R is installed it should be kept up-to-date.</p>
</div>
<div id="updating-r" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Updating R</h3>
<p>R is a mature and stable language so well-written code in base R should work on most versions. However, it is important to keep your R version relatively up-to-date, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bug fixes are introduced in each version, making errors less likely;</li>
<li>Performance enhancements are made from one version to the next, meaning your code may run faster in later versions;</li>
<li>Many R packages only work on recent versions on R.</li>
</ul>
<p>Release notes with details on each of these issues are hosted at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/NEWS">cran.r-project.org/src/base/NEWS</a>. R release versions have 3 components corresponding to major.minor.patch changes. Generally 2 or 3 patches are released before the next minor increment. R 3.2, for example, has consisted of 3 versions: 3.2.0, 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Ubuntu-based systems, new versions of R should be automatically detected through the software management system, and can be installed with <code>apt-get upgrade</code>.</li>
<li>On Mac, the latest version should be installed by the user from the <code>.pkg</code> files mentioned above.</li>
<li><p>On Windows <code>installr</code> package makes updating easy:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># check and install the latest R version</span>
installr::<span class="kw">updateR</span>() </code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>For information about changes to expect in the next version, you can subscribe to the R’s NEWS RSS feed: <a href="http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS/index.rss">developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel/NEWS/index.rss</a>. It’s a good way of keeping up to date.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-r-packages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Installing R packages</h3>
<p>Large projects may need several packages to be installed. In this case, the required packages can be installed at once. Using the example of packages for handling spatial data, this can be done quickly and concisely with the following code:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">pkgs =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="st">&quot;raster&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;leaflet&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;rgeos&quot;</span>) <span class="co"># package names</span>
<span class="kw">install.packages</span>(pkgs)</code></pre>
<p>In the above code all the required packages are installed with two not three lines, reducing typing. Note that we can now re-use the <code>pkgs</code> object to load them all:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">inst =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">lapply</span>(pkgs, library, <span class="dt">character.only =</span> <span class="ot">TRUE</span>) <span class="co"># load them</span></code></pre>
<p>In the above code <code>library(pkg[i])</code> is executed for every package stored in the text string vector. We use <code>library</code> here instead of <code>require</code> because the former produces an error if the package is not available.</p>
<p>Loading all packages at the begginning of a script is good practice as it ensures all dependencies have been installed <em>before</em> time is spent executing code. Storing package names in a character vector object such as <code>pkgs</code> is also useful because it allows us to refer back to them again and again. To provide another example, we can update only the packages named in <code>pkgs</code> with the following command:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">update.packages</span>(<span class="dt">oldPkgs =</span> pkgs)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="deps" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.4</span> Installing R packages with dependencies</h3>
<p>Some packages have external dependencies (i.e. they call libraries outside R). On Unix-like systems, these are best installed onto the operating system, bypassing <code>install.packages</code>. This will ensure the necessary dependencies are installed and setup correctly alongside the R package. On Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu, for example, packages with names starting with <code>r-cran-</code> can be search for and installed as follows (see <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/">cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/</a> for a list of these):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">apt-cache</span> search r-cran- <span class="co"># search for available cran Debian packages</span>
<span class="kw">sudo</span> apt-get-install r-cran-rgdal <span class="co"># install the rgdal package (with dependencies)</span></code></pre>
<p>On Windows the <code>installr</code> package helps manage and update R packages with system-level dependencies. For example the <code>Rtools</code> package for compiling C/C++ code on Window can be installed with the following command:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">installr::<span class="kw">install.rtools</span>() </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="updating-r-packages" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.5</span> Updating R packages</h3>
<p>An efficient R set-up will contain up-to-date packages. This can be done <em>for all packages</em> with:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">update.packages</span>() <span class="co"># update installed CRAN packages</span></code></pre>
<p>The default for this function is for the <code>ask</code> argument to be set to <code>TRUE</code>, giving control over what is downloaded onto your system.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This is a good thing: updating dozens of large packages can consume a large proportion of available system resources and much time!</p>
<p>An even more interactive method for updating packages in R is provided by RStudio via Tools &gt; Check for Package Updates. Many such time saving tricks are enabled by RStudio, as described in <a href="#install-rstudio">a subsequent section</a>. Next (after the exercises) we take a look at how to configure R using startup files.</p>
</div>
<div id="exercises-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.6</span> Exercises</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What version of R are you using? Is it the most up-to-date?</li>
<li>Do any of your packages need updating?</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="r-startup" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> R startup</h2>
<p>Every time R starts, a number of files are read, in a particular order. The contents of these files determine how R performs for the duration of the session. Note that these files should only be changed with caution, as they may make your R version behave differently to other R installations. This could reduce the reproducibility of your code.</p>
<p>Files in three folders are important in this process:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>R_HOME</code>, the directory in which R is installed. The <code>etc</code> sub-directory can contain startup files read early on in the startup process. Find out where your <code>R_HOME</code> is with the <code>R.home()</code> command.</p></li>
<li><p><code>HOME</code>, the user’s home directory. Typically this is <code>/home/username</code> on Unix machines or <code>C:\Users\username</code> on Windows (since Windows 7). Ask R where your home directory with, <code>path.expand(&quot;~&quot;)</code> (note the use of the Unix-like tilde to represent the home directory).</p></li>
<li><p>R’s current working directory. This is reported by <code>getwd()</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to know the location of the <code>.Rprofile</code> and <code>.Renviron</code> setup files that are being used out of these three options. R only uses one <code>.Rprofile</code> and one <code>.Renviron</code> in any session: if you have a <code>.Rprofile</code> file in your current project, R will ignore <code>.Rprofile</code> in <code>R_HOME</code> and <code>HOME</code>. Likewise, <code>.Rprofile</code> in <code>HOME</code> overrides <code>.Rprofile</code> in <code>R_HOME</code>. The same applies to <code>.Renviron</code>: you should remember that adding project specific environment variables with <code>.Renviron</code> will de-activate other <code>.Renviron</code> files.</p>
<p>To create a project specific setup R code you simply create a <code>.Rprofile</code> file in the project’s root directory and start adding R code, e.g. via <code>file.edit(&quot;.Rprofile&quot;)</code>. Remember that this will make <code>.Rprofile</code> in the home directory be ignored. To change the user-level settings from within an R editor such as RStudio, this would be:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">file.edit</span>(<span class="kw">file.path</span>(<span class="st">&quot;~&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;.Rprofile&quot;</span>))</code></pre>
<p>Note that editing the <code>.Renviron</code> file in the same locations will have the same effect. The following code will create a user specific <code>.Renviron</code> file (where API keys and other cross-project environment variables can be stored), without overwriting any existing file.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">user_renviron =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">path.expand</span>(<span class="kw">file.path</span>(<span class="st">&quot;~&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;.Renviron&quot;</span>))
if(!<span class="kw">file.exists</span>(user_renviron)) <span class="co"># check to see if the file already exists</span>
  <span class="kw">file.create</span>(user_renviron)
<span class="kw">file.edit</span>(user_renviron) <span class="co"># open with another text editor if this fails</span></code></pre>
<p>The location, contents and uses of each is outlined in more detail below.</p>
<div id="rprofile" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> The <code>.Rprofile</code> file</h3>
<p>By default R looks for and runs <code>.Rprofile</code> files in the three locations described above, in a specific order. <code>.Rprofile</code> files are simply R scripts that run each time R runs and they can be found within <code>R_HOME</code>, <code>HOME</code> and the project’s home directory, found with <code>getwd()</code>. To check if you have a site-wide <code>.Rprofile</code>, which will run for all users on start-up, run:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">site_path =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">R.home</span>(<span class="dt">component =</span> <span class="st">&quot;home&quot;</span>)
fname =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">file.path</span>(site_path, <span class="st">&quot;etc&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;Rprofile.site&quot;</span>)
<span class="kw">file.exists</span>(fname)</code></pre>
<p>The above code checks for the presence of <code>Rprofile.site</code> in that directory. As outlined above, the <code>.Rprofile</code> located in your home directory is user-specific. Again, we can test whether this file exists using</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">file.exists</span>(<span class="st">&quot;~/.Rprofile&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p>We can use R to create and edit <code>.Rprofile</code> (warning: do not overwrite your previous <code>.Rprofile</code> - we suggest you try project-specific <code>.Rprofile</code> first):</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">if(!<span class="kw">file.exists</span>(<span class="st">&quot;~/.Rprofile&quot;</span>)) <span class="co"># only create if not already there</span>
  <span class="kw">file.create</span>(<span class="st">&quot;~/.Rprofile&quot;</span>)    <span class="co"># (don&#39;t overwrite it)</span>
<span class="kw">file.edit</span>(<span class="st">&quot;~/.Rprofile&quot;</span>)</code></pre>

<div id="example-.rprofile-settings" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Example <code>.Rprofile</code> settings</h3>
<p>An <code>.Rprofile</code> file is just an R script that is run at start-up. The examples at the bottom of the <code>.Rprofile</code> help file</p>

<div id="setting-options" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2.1</span> Setting options</h4>
<p>The function <code>options</code> is a list that contains a number of default options. See <code>help(&quot;options&quot;)</code> or simply type <code>options()</code> to get an idea of what we can configure. In my <code>.Rprofile</code> file, we have the line</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">options</span>(<span class="dt">prompt=</span><span class="st">&quot;R&gt; &quot;</span>, <span class="dt">digits=</span><span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dt">show.signif.stars=</span><span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</code></pre>
<p>This changes three features.</p>
<ul>
<li>The R prompt, from the boring <code>&gt;</code> to the exciting <code>R&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>The number of digits displayed.</li>
<li>Removing the stars after significant <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically we want to avoid adding options to the start-up file that make our code non-portable. For example, adding</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">options</span>(<span class="dt">stringsAsFactors=</span><span class="ot">FALSE</span>)</code></pre>
<p>to your start-up script has knock-on effects for <code>read.table</code> and related functions including <code>read.csv</code>, making them convert text strings into characters rather than into factors as is default. This may be useful for you, but it is dangerous as it may make your code less portable.</p>

<div id="setting-the-cran-mirror" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2.2</span> Setting the CRAN mirror</h4>
<p>To avoid setting the CRAN mirror each time you run <code>install.packages</code> you can permanently set the mirror in your <code>.Rprofile</code>.</p>

</div>
<div id="the-fortunes-package" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2.3</span> The <code>fortunes</code> package</h4>
<p>This section illustrate what <code>.Rprofile</code> does with reference to a package that was developed for fun. The code below could easily be altered to automatically connect to a database, or ensure that the latest packages have been downloaded.</p>
<p>The <code>fortunes</code> package contains a number of memorable quotes that the community has collected over many years, called <code>R fortunes</code>. Each fortune has a number. To get fortune number <span class="math">\(50\)</span>, for example, enter</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">fortunes::<span class="kw">fortune</span>(<span class="dv">50</span>)</code></pre>
<p>It is easy to make R print out one of these nuggets of truth each time you start a session, by adding the following to <code>~/.Rprofile</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">if(<span class="kw">interactive</span>()) 
  <span class="kw">try</span>(fortunes::<span class="kw">fortune</span>(), <span class="dt">silent=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>interactive</code> function tests whether R is being used interactively in a terminal. The <code>fortune</code> function is called within <code>try</code>. If the <code>fortunes</code> package is not available, we avoid raising an error and move on. By using <code>::</code> we avoid adding the fortunes package to our list of attached packages..</p>
<p>The function <code>.Last</code>, if it exists in the <code>.Rprofile</code>, is always run at the end of the session. We can use it to install the <code>fortunes</code> package if needed. To load the package, we use <code>require</code>, since if the package isn’t installed, the <code>require</code> function returns <code>FALSE</code> and raises a warning.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">.Last =<span class="st"> </span>function() {
  cond =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">suppressWarnings</span>(!<span class="kw">require</span>(fortunes, <span class="dt">quietly=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>))
  if(cond) 
    <span class="kw">try</span>(<span class="kw">install.packages</span>(<span class="st">&quot;fortunes&quot;</span>), <span class="dt">silent=</span><span class="ot">TRUE</span>)
  <span class="kw">message</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Goodbye at &quot;</span>, <span class="kw">date</span>(), <span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\n</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="useful-functions" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2.4</span> Useful functions</h4>
<p>You can also load useful functions in <code>.Rprofile</code>. For example, we could load the following two functions for examining data frames:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">## ht == headtail
ht =<span class="st"> </span>function(d, <span class="dt">n=</span><span class="dv">6</span>) <span class="kw">rbind</span>(<span class="kw">head</span>(d, n), <span class="kw">tail</span>(d, n))
  
## Show the first 5 rows &amp; first 5 columns of a data frame
hh =<span class="st"> </span>function(d) d[<span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>:<span class="dv">5</span>]</code></pre>
<p>and a function for setting a nice plotting window:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">setnicepar =<span class="st"> </span>function(<span class="dt">mar =</span> <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>), <span class="dt">mgp =</span> <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="fl">0.4</span>, <span class="dv">0</span>), 
                      <span class="dt">tck =</span> -.<span class="dv">01</span>, <span class="dt">cex.axis =</span> <span class="fl">0.9</span>, 
                      <span class="dt">las =</span> <span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dt">mfrow =</span> <span class="kw">c</span>(<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">1</span>), ...) {
    <span class="kw">par</span>(<span class="dt">mar =</span> mar, <span class="dt">mgp =</span> mgp, <span class="dt">tck =</span> tck,
        <span class="dt">cex.axis =</span> cex.axis, <span class="dt">las =</span> las, 
        <span class="dt">mfrow =</span> mfrow, ...)
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that these functions are for personal use and are unlikely to interfere with code from other people. For this reason even if you use a certain package every day, we don’t recommend loading it in your <code>.Rprofile</code>. Also beware the dangers of loading many functions by default: it may make your code less portable. Another downside of putting functions in your <code>.Rprofile</code> is that it can clutter-up your work space: when you run the <code>ls()</code> command, your <code>.Rprofile</code> functions will appear. Also if you run <code>rm(list=ls())</code>, your functions will be deleted.</p>
<p>One neat trick to overcome this issue is to use hidden objects and environments. When an object name starts with <code>.</code>, by default it doesn’t appear in the output of the <code>ls()</code> function</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">.obj =<span class="st"> </span><span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="st">&quot;.obj&quot;</span> %in%<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">ls</span>()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<p>This concept also works with environments. In the <code>.Rprofile</code> file we can create a <em>hidden</em> environment</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">.env =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">new.env</span>()</code></pre>
<p>and then add functions to this environment</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">.env$ht =<span class="st"> </span>function(d, <span class="dt">n =</span> <span class="dv">6</span>) <span class="kw">rbind</span>(<span class="kw">head</span>(d, n), <span class="kw">tail</span>(d, n))</code></pre>
<p>At the end of the <code>.Rprofile</code> file, we use <code>attach</code>, which makes it possible to refer to objects in the environment by their names alone.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">attach</span>(.env)</code></pre>

<div id="renviron" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> The <code>.Renviron</code> file</h3>
<p>The <code>.Renviron</code> file is used to store system variables. It follows a similar start up routine to the <code>.Rprofile</code> file: R first looks for a global <code>.Renviron</code> file, then for local versions. A typical use of the <code>.Renviron</code> file is to specify the <code>R_LIBS</code> path</p>
<pre><code>## Linux
R_LIBS=~/R/library

## Windows
R_LIBS=C:/R/library</code></pre>
<p>This variable points to a directory where R packages will be installed. When <code>install.packages</code> is called, new packages will be stored in <code>R_LIBS</code>.</p>
<p>Another common use of <code>.Renviron</code> is to store API keys that will be available from one session to another.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The following line in <code>.Renviron</code>, for example, sets the <code>ZEIT_KEY</code> environment variable which is used in the package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diezeit/">diezeit</a> package:</p>
<pre><code>ZEIT_KEY=PUT_YOUR_KEY_HERE</code></pre>
<p>You will need to sign-in and start a new R session for the environment variable (accessed by <code>Sys.getenv</code>) to be visible. To test if the example API key has been successfully added as an environment variable, run the following:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">Sys.getenv</span>(<span class="st">&quot;ZEIT_KEY&quot;</span>)</code></pre>
<p>Use of the <code>.Renviron</code> file for storing settings such as library paths and API keys is efficient because it reduces the need to update your settings for every R session. Furthermore, the same <code>.Renviron</code> file will work across different platforms so keep it stored safely.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> RStudio</h2>
<p>RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. It makes life easy for R users and developers with its intuitive and flexible interface. RStudio encourages good programming practice. Through its wide range of features RStudio can help make you a more efficient and productive R programmer, for example by reducing the amount of time spent remembering and typing function names thanks to intelligent autocompletion. Some of the most important features of RStudio include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexible window pane layouts to optimise use of screen space and enable fast interactive visual feed-back.</li>
<li>Intelligent auto-completion of function names, packages and R objects.</li>
<li>A wide range of keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>Visual display of objects, including a searchable data display table.</li>
<li>Real-time code checking and error detection.</li>
<li>Menus to install and update packages.</li>
<li>Project management and integration with version control.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list of features should make it clear that a well set-up IDE can be as important as a well set-up R installation for becoming an efficient R programmer.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> As with R itself, the best way to learn about RStudio is by using it. It is therefore worth reading through this section in parallel with using RStudio to boost your productivity.</p>
<div id="install-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Installing and updating RStudio</h3>
<p>RStudio can be installed from the RStudio website <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">rstudio.com</a> and is available for all major operating systems. Updating RStudio is simple: click on <code>Help &gt; Check for Updates</code> in the menu. For fast and efficient work keyboard shortcuts should be used wherever possible, reducing the reliance on the mouse. RStudio has many keyboard shortcuts that will help with this. To get into good habits early, try accessing the RStudio Update interface without touching the mouse. On Linux and Windows dropdown menus are activated with the <code>Alt</code> button, so the menu item can be found with:</p>
<pre><code>Alt+H U</code></pre>
<p>On Mac it works differently. <code>Cmd+?</code> should activate a search across menu items, allowing the same operation can be achieved with:</p>
<pre><code>Cmd+? update</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> in RStudio the keyboard shortcuts differ between Linux and Windows versions on one hand and Mac on the other. In this section we generally only use the Windows/Linux shortcut keys for brevity. The Mac equivalent is usually found by simply replacing <code>Ctl</code> and <code>Alt</code> with the Mac-specific <code>Cmd</code> button.</p>
</div>
<div id="window-pane-layout" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.2</span> Window pane layout</h3>
<p>RStudio has four main window ‘panes’ (see Figure 2-2 below), each of which serves a range of purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Source pane</strong>, for editing, saving, and dispatching R code to the console (top left). Note that this pane does not exist by default when you start RStudio: it appears when you open an R script, e.g. via File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Script. A common task in this pane is to send code on the current line to the console, via <code>Ctl-Enter</code> (or <code>Cmd-Enter</code> on Mac).</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Console pane</strong>. Any code entered here is processed by R, line by line. This pane is ideal for interactively testing ideas before saving the final results in the Source pane above.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Environment pane</strong> (top right) contains information about the current objects loaded in the workspace including their class, dimension (if they are a data frame) and name. This pane also contains tabbed sub-panes with a searchable history that was dispatched to the console and (if applicable to the project) Build and Git options.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Files pane</strong> (bottom right) contains a simple file browser, a Plots tab, Help and Package tabs and a Viewer for visualising interactive R output such as those produced by the leaflet package and HTML ‘widgets’.</p></li>

</div>
<div id="rstudio-options" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.4</span> RStudio options</h3>
<p>A range of <code>Project Options</code> and <code>Global Options</code> are available in RStudio from the <code>Tools</code> menu (accessible in Linux and Windows from the keyboard via <code>Alt+T</code>). Most of these are self-explanatory but it is worth mentioning a few that can boost your programming efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>GIT/SVN project settings allow RStudio to provide a graphical interface to your version control system, described in Chapter XX.</p></li>
<li><p>R version settings allow RStudio to ‘point’ to different R versions/interpreters, which may be faster for some projects.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Restore .RData</code>: Unticking this default preventing loading previously creating R objects. This will make starting R quicker and also reduce the change of getting bugs due to previously created objects.</p></li>
<li><p>Code editing options can make RStudio adapt to your coding style, for example, by preventing the autocompletion of braces, which some experienced programmers may find annoying. Enabling <code>Vim mode</code> makes RStudio act as a (partial) Vim emulator.</p></li>
<li><p>Diagnostic settings can make RStudio more efficient by adding additional diagnostics or by removing diagnostics if they are slowing down your work. This may be an issue for people using RStudio to analyse large datasets on older low-spec computers.</p></li>
<li><p>Appearance: if you are struggling to see the source code, changing the default font size may make you a more efficient programmer by reducing the time overheads associated with squinting at the screen. Other options in this area relate more to aesthetics, which are also important because feeling comfortable in your programming environment can boost productivity.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="auto-completion" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.5</span> Auto-completion</h3>
<p>R provides some basic autocompletion functionality. Typing the beginning of a function name, for example <code>rn</code> (short for <code>rnorm()</code>), and hitting <code>Tab</code> will result in the full function names associated with this text string being printed. In this case two options would be displayed: <code>rnbinom</code> and <code>rnorm</code>, providing a useful reminder to the user about what is available. The same applies to file names enclosed in quote marks: typing <code>te</code> in the console in a project which contains a file called <code>test.R</code> should result in the full name <code>&quot;test.R&quot;</code> being auto-completed. RStudio builds on this functionality and takes it to a new level.</p>
<p>Instead of only auto completing options when <code>Tab</code> is pressed, RStudio auto completes them at any point. Building on the previous example, RStudio’s autocompletion triggers when the first three characters are typed: <code>rno</code>. The same functionality works when only the first characters are typed, followed by <code>Tab</code>: automatic auto-completion does not replace <code>Tab</code> autocompletion but supplements it. Note that in RStudio two more options are provided to the user after entering <code>rn Tab</code> compared with entering the same text into base R’s console described in the previous paragraph: <code>RNGkind</code> and <code>RNGversion</code>. This illustrates that RStudio’s autocompletion functionality is not case sensitive in the same way that R is. This is a good thing because R has no consistent function name style!</p>
<p>RStudio also has more intelligent auto-completion of objects and file names than R’s built-in command line. To test this functionality, try typing <code>US</code>, followed by the Tab key. After pressing down until <code>USArrests</code> is selected, press Enter so it autocompletes. Finally, typing <code>$</code> should leave the following text on the screen and the four columns should be shown in a drop-down box, ready for you to select the variable of interest with the down arrow.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">USArrests$<span class="st"> </span><span class="co"># a dropdown menu of columns should appear in RStudio</span></code></pre>
<p>To take a more complex example, variable names stored in the <code>data</code> slot of the class <code>SpatialPolygonsDataFrame</code> (a class defined by the foundational spatial package sp) are referred to in the long form <code>spdf@data$varname</code>.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> In this case <code>spdf</code> is the object name, <code>data</code> is the slot and <code>varname</code> is the variable name. RStudio makes such <code>S4</code> objects easier to use by enabling autocompletion of the short form <code>spdf$varname</code>. Another example is RStudio’s ability to find files hidden away in sub-folders. Typing <code>&quot;te</code> will find <code>test.R</code> even if it is located in a sub-folder such as <code>R/test.R</code>. There are a number of other clever auto-completion tricks that can boost R’s productivity when using RStudio which are best found by experimenting and hitting <code>Tab</code> frequently during your R programming work.</p>
</div>
<div id="keyboard-shortcuts" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.6</span> Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<p>RStudio has many useful shortcuts that can help make your programming more efficient by reducing the need to reach for the mouse and point and click your way around code and RStudio. These can be viewed by using a little known but extremely useful keyboard shortcut:</p>
<pre><code>Alt+Shift+K</code></pre>
<p>This will display the default shortcuts in RStudio. It is worth spending time identifying which of these could be useful in your work and practicing interacting with RStudio rapidly with minimal reliance on the mouse. Some more <a href="http://stronginstruments.com/2014/11/26/rstudio-shortcuts-windows-for-cleaner-and-faster-coding/">useful</a> shortcuts are listed below. There are many more gems to find that could boost your R writing productivity:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Ctl+Z/Shift+Z</code>: Undo/Redo.</li>
<li><code>Ctl+Enter</code>: Execute the current line or code selection in the Source pane.</li>
<li><code>Ctl+Alt+R</code>: Execute all the R code in the currently open file in the Source pane.</li>
<li><code>Ctl+Left/Right</code>: Navigate code quickly, word by word.</li>
<li><code>Home/End</code>: Navigate to the beginning/end of the current line.</li>
<li><code>Alt+Shift+Up/Down</code>: Duplicate the current line up or down.</li>
<li><code>Ctl+D</code>: Delete the current line.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.7</span> Object display and output table</h3>
<p>It is useful to know what is in your current R environment. This information can be revealed with <code>ls()</code>, but this function only provides object names. RStudio provides an efficient mechanism to show currently loaded objects, and their details, in real-time: the Environment tab in the top right corner. It makes sense to keep an eye on which objects are loaded and to delete objects that are no longer useful. Doing so will minimise the probability of confusion in your workflow (e.g. by using the wrong version of an object) and reduce the amount of RAM R needs. The details provided in the Environment tab include the object’s dimension and some additional details depending on the object’s class (e.g. size in MB for large datasets).</p>
<p>A very useful feature of RStudio is its advanced viewing functionality. This is triggered either by executing <code>View(object)</code> or by double clicking on the object name in the Environment tab. Although you cannot edit data in the Viewer (this should be considered a good thing from a data integrity perspective), recent versions of RStudio provide an efficient search mechanism to rapidly filter and view the records that are of most interest (see Figure 2-3 above).</p>
</div>
<div id="project-management" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.8</span> Project management</h3>
<p>In the far top-right of RStudio there is a diminutive drop-down menu illustrated with R inside a transparent box. This menu may be small and simple, but it is hugely efficient in terms of organising large, complex and long-term projects.</p>
<p>The idea of RStudio projects is that the bulk of R programming work is part of a wider task, which will likely consist of input data, R code, graphical and numerical outputs and documents describing the work. It is possible to scatter each of these elements at random across your hard-discs but this is not recommended. Instead, the concept of projects encourages reproducible working, such that anyone who opens the particular project folder that you are working from should be able to repeat your analyses and replicate your results.</p>
<p>It is therefore <em>highly recommended</em> that you use projects to organise your work. It could save hours in the long-run. Organizing data, code and outputs also makes sense from a portability perspective: if you copy the folder (e.g. via GitHub) your can work on it from any computer without worrying about having the right files on your current machine. These tasks are implemented using RStudio’s simple project system, in which the following things happen each time you open an existing project:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The working directory automatically switches to the project’s folder. This enables data and script files to be referred to using relative file paths, which are much shorter than absolute file paths. This means that switching directory using <code>setwd()</code>, a common source of error for R users, is rarely if ever needed.</p></li>
<li><p>The last previously open file is loaded into the Source pane. The history of R commands executed in previous sessions is also loaded into the History tab. This assists with continuity between one session and the next.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>File</code> tab displays the associated files and folders in the project, allowing you to quickly find your previous work.</p></li>
<li><p>Any settings associated with the project, such as Git settings, are loaded. This assists with collaboration and project-specific set-up.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each project is different but most contain input data, R code and outputs. To keep things tidy, we recommend a sub-directory structure resembling the following:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">project/</span>
  <span class="kw">-</span> README.rmd <span class="co"># Project description</span>
  <span class="kw">-</span> set-up.R  <span class="co"># Required packages</span>
  <span class="kw">-</span> R/ <span class="co"># For R code</span>
  <span class="kw">-</span> input <span class="co"># Data files</span>
  <span class="kw">-</span> graphics/
  <span class="kw">-</span> output/ <span class="co"># Results</span></code></pre>
<p>Proper use of projects ensures that all R source files are neatly stashed in one folder with a meaningful structure. This way data and documentation can be found where one would expect them. Under this system figures and project outputs are ‘first class citizens’ within the project’s design, each with their own folder.</p>
<p>Another approach to project management is to treat projects as R packages. Creating R packages is easier than ever before, with tools such as <code>devtools</code> for managing R’s quirks and making the process user friendly. If you use GitHub, the advantage of this approach is that anyone should be able to reproduce your working using <code>devtools::install_github(&quot;username/projectname&quot;)</code>, although the administrative overheads of creating an entire package for each small project will outweigh the benefits for many.</p>
<p>Note that a <code>set-up.R</code> or even a <code>.Rprofile</code> file in the project’s root directory enable project-specific settings to be loaded each time people work on the project. As described in the previous section, <code>.Rprofile</code> can be used to tweak how R works at start-up. It is also a portable way to manage R’s configuration on a project-by-project basis.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> BLAS and alternative R interpreters</h2>
<p>In this section we cover a few system-level options available to speed-up R’s performance. Note that for many applications stability rather than speed is a priority, so these should only be considered if a) you have exhausted options for writing your R code more efficiently and b) you are confident tweaking system-level settings. This should therefore be seen as an advanced section: if you are not interested in speeding-up base R, feel free to skip to the next section of hardware.</p>
<p>Many statistical algorithms manipulate matrices. R uses the Basic Linear Algebra System (BLAS) framework for linear algebra operations. Whenever we carry out a matrix operation, such as transpose or finding the inverse, we use the underlying BLAS library. By switching to a different BLAS library, it may be possible to speed-up your R code. Changing your BLAS library is straightforward if you are using Linux, but can be tricky for Windows users.</p>
<p>The two open source alternative BLAS libraries are <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS">OpenBLAS</a>. The <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl">Intel MKL</a> is another implementation, designed for Intel processors by Intel and used in Revolution R (described in the next section) but it requires licensing fees. The MKL library is provided with the Revolution analytics system. Depending on your application, by switching you BLAS library, linear algebra operations can run several times faster than with the base BLAS routines.</p>
<!--
 Currently only works for linux.
 
To find out what BLAS library you are using on Linux the following function, from the [benchmarkme](https://github.com/csgillespie/benchmarkme) package can be used:


```r
# devtools::install_github("csgillespie/benchmarkme")
benchmarkme::get_linear_algebra()
```

<div id="revolution-r" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.1</span> Revolution R</h3>
<p>Revolution R is the main software product offered by Revolution Analytics. It is “100%” compatible with R“, supporting all available packages through the MRAN package repository. Revolution R provides faster performance on for certain functions than base R, through its use of MKL, an implementation of BLAS (as described above). Revolution R is available as a free and open source product, ‘Revolution R Open’ (RRO), and is reported to be faster than base R installations.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Additional benchmarks reported by <span class="citation">Eddelbuettel (2010)</span> show the MKL implementations of R used in RRO and the commercial edition to be substantially faster than the reference case.</p>
</div>
<div id="other-interpreters" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.5.2</span> Other interpreters</h3>
<p>Due to the popularity of R, it now possible to use alternative interpreters (the interpreter is where the code is run). There are currently four possibilities</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pqr-project.org/">pqrR</a> (pretty quick R) is a new version of the R interpreter. One major downside, is that it is based on R-2.15.0. The developer (Radford Neal) has made many improvements, some of which have now been incorporated into base R. <strong>pqR</strong> is an open-source project licensed under the GPL. One notable improvement in pqR is that it is able to do some numeric computations in parallel with each other, and with other operations of the interpreter, on systems with multiple processors or processor cores.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.renjin.org/">Renjin</a> reimplements the R interpreter in Java, so it can run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Since R will be pure Java, it can run anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://spotfire.tibco.com/">Tibco</a> created a C++ based interpreter called TERR.</p></li>
<li><p>Oracle also offer an R-interpreter that uses Intel’s mathematics library and therefore achieves a higher performance without changing R’s core.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing, switching interpreters is something to consider carefully. But in the future, it may become more routine.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Efficient hardware</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw how relatively simple tweaks to our system set-up can result in substantial time savings. In this chapter we explore the relationship between computer hardware and the speed of code execution. The goal is to help you decide whether the benefits of upgrading your hardware are worth the cost.</p>
<p>We’ll begin with an introductory section on computer storage and memory and how it is measured, before moving on to individual computer components.</p>
<div id="introduction-what-is-a-byte" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction: what is a byte?</h2>
<p>A computer cannot store “numbers” or “letters”. The only thing a computer can store and work with is bits. A bit is binary, it is either a <span class="math">\(0\)</span> or a <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. In fact from a physics perspective, a bit is just a blip of electricity that either is or isn’t there.</p>
<p>In the past the ASCII character set dominated computing. This set defines <span class="math">\(128\)</span> characters including <span class="math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(9\)</span>, upper and lower case alpha-numeric and a few control characters such as a new line. To store these characters required <span class="math">\(7\)</span> bits since <span class="math">\(2^7 = 128\)</span>, but <span class="math">\(8\)</span> bits were typically used for performance <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/14690159/203420">reasons</a>. Table 3.1 gives the binary representation of the first few characters.</p>

<p>Table 3.1: The bit representation of a few ASCII characters.</p>
<p>The limitation of only gives having <span class="math">\(256\)</span> characters led to the development of Unicode, a standard framework aimed at creating a single character set for every reasonable writing system. Typically, Unicode characters require sixteen bits of storage.</p>
<p>Eight bits is one byte, or ASCII character. So two ASCII characters would use two bytes or <span class="math">\(16\)</span> bits. A pure text document containing <span class="math">\(100\)</span> characters would use <span class="math">\(100\)</span> bytes (<span class="math">\(800\)</span> bits). Note that mark-up, such as font information or meta-data, can impose a substantial memory overhead: an empty <code>.docx</code> file requires about <span class="math">\(3,700\)</span> bytes of storage.</p>
<p>When computer scientists first started to think about computer memory, they noticed that <span class="math">\(2^{10} = 1024 \simeq 10^3\)</span> and <span class="math">\(2^{20} =1,048,576\simeq 10^6\)</span>, so they adopted the short hand of kilo- and mega-bytes. Of course, <em>everyone</em> knew that it was just a short hand, and it was really a binary power. When computers became more wide spread, foolish people like you and me just assumed that kilo actually meant <span class="math">\(10^3\)</span> bytes.</p>
<p>Fortunately the IEEE Standards Board intervened and created conventional, internationally adopted definitions of the International System of Units (SI) prefixes. So a kilobyte (KB) is <span class="math">\(10^3 = 1000\)</span> bytes and a megabyte (MB) is <span class="math">\(10^6\)</span> bytes or <span class="math">\(10^3\)</span> kilobytes (see table 3.2). A petabyte is approximately <span class="math">\(100\)</span> million drawers filled with text. Astonishingly Google processes around <span class="math">\(20\)</span> petabytes of data every day.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Random access memory: RAM</h2>
<p>Random access memory (RAM) is a type of computer memory that can be accessed randomly: any byte of memory can be accessed without touching the preceding bytes. RAM is found in computers, phones, tablets and even printers. The amount of RAM R has access to is directly related to the size of data sets that it can process. As the amount of RAM your machine has increases, the size of datasets you can analyse also increases, so it is important to have sufficient RAM for your work.</p>

<p>Even if the original data set is relatively small, the analysis can generate large objects. For example, suppose we want to perform standard cluster analysis. The built-in data set <code>USAarrests</code>, is a data frame with <span class="math">\(50\)</span> rows and <span class="math">\(4\)</span> columns. Each row corresponds to a state in the USA</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">head</span>(USArrests, <span class="dv">3</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape
## Alabama   13.2     236       58 21.2
## Alaska    10.0     263       48 44.5
## Arizona    8.1     294       80 31.0</code></pre>
<p>If we want to group states that have similar crime statistics, a standard first step is to calculate the distance or similarity matrix</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">d =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">dist</span>(USArrests)</code></pre>
<p>When we inspect the object size of the original data set and the distance object using the <code>pryr</code> package</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">pryr::<span class="kw">object_size</span>(USArrests)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 5.23 kB</code></pre>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">pryr::<span class="kw">object_size</span>(d)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 14.3 kB</code></pre>
<p>we have managed to create an object that is three times larger than the original data set. In fact the object <code>d</code> is a symmetric <span class="math">\(n \times n\)</span> matrix, where <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is the number of rows in <code>USAarrests</code>. Clearly, as <code>n</code> increases the size of <code>d</code> increases at rate <span class="math">\(O(n^2)\)</span>. So if our original data set contained <span class="math">\(10,000\)</span> records, the associated distance matrix would contain almost <span class="math">\(10^8\)</span> values. Of course since the matrix is symmetric, this corresponds to around <span class="math">\(50\)</span> million unique values. A rough rule of thumb is that your RAM should be three times the size of your data set.</p>
<p>Another benefit of having increasing the amount of onboard RAM is that the ‘garbage collector’, a process that runs periodically to free-up system memory occupied by R, is called less often (we will cover this in more detail in chapter XXX).</p>
<p>It is straightforward to determine how much RAM you have. Under Windows,</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Clicking the <code>Start</code> button picture of the Start button, then right-clicking Computer. Next click on <code>Properties</code>.</li>
<li>In the <code>System</code> section, you can see the amount of RAM your computer has next to the <code>Installed memory (RAM)</code> section. Windows reports how much RAM it can use, not the amount installed. This is only an issue if you are using a 32-bit version of Windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Mac, click the Apple menu. Select <code>About This Mac</code> and a window appears with the relevant information.</p>
<p>On almost all Unix-based OSs, you can find out how much RAM you have using the code <code>vmstat</code>, whilst on all Linux distributions, you can use the command <code>free</code>. Using this in conjuction with the <code>-h</code> tag will provide the answer in human readable format, as illustrated below for a 16 Gb machine:</p>
<pre><code>$ free -h
             total       used       free     
Mem:           15G       4.0G        11G </code></pre>
<p>It is sometimes possible to increase your computer’s RAM. On the computer motherboard, there are typically <span class="math">\(2\)</span> or <span class="math">\(4\)</span> RAM or memory slots. If you have free slots, then you can add more RAM. However, it is common that all slots are already taken. This means that to upgrade your computer’s memory, some or all of the RAM will have to be removed. To go from <span class="math">\(8\)</span>GB to <span class="math">\(16\)</span>GB, for example, you may have to discard the two <span class="math">\(4\)</span>GB RAM cards and replace them with two <span class="math">\(8\)</span>GB cards. Increasing your laptop/desktop from 4GB to <span class="math">\(16\)</span>GB or <span class="math">\(32\)</span>GB is cheap and should definitely be considered. As R Core member Uwe Ligges states,</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">fortunes::<span class="kw">fortune</span>(<span class="dv">192</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## RAM is cheap and thinking hurts.
##    -- Uwe Ligges (about memory requirements in R)
##       R-help (June 2007)</code></pre>
<p>It is a testament to the design of R that it is still relevant and its popularity is growing. Ross Ihaka, one of the originators of the R programming language, made a throw-away comment in 2003:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">fortunes::<span class="kw">fortune</span>(<span class="dv">21</span>)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## I seem to recall that we were targetting 512k Macintoshes. In our dreams
## we might have seen 16Mb Sun.
##    -- Ross Ihaka (in reply to the question whether R&amp;R thought when they
##       started out that they would see R using 16G memory on a dual Opteron
##       computer)
##       R-help (November 2003)</code></pre>
<p>Considering that a standard smart phone now contains <span class="math">\(1\)</span>GB of RAM, the fact that R was designed for “basic” computers, but can scale across clusters is impressive. R’s origins on computers with limited resources helps explain its efficiency at dealing with large datasets.</p>

<p>Unless you have a fairly expensive laptop your computer probably has a standard hard disk drive (HDD). HDDs were first introduced by IBM in 1956. Data is stored using magnetism on a rotating platter, as shown in Figure 3.2. The faster the platter spins, the faster the HDD can perform. Many laptop drives spin at either <span class="math">\(5400\)</span>RPM (Revolutions per Minute) or <span class="math">\(7200\)</span>RPM. The major advantage of HDDs is that they are cheap, making a <span class="math">\(1\)</span>TB laptop standard.</p>

<p>Solid state drives (SSDs) can be thought of as large, but more sophisticated versions of USB sticks. They have no moving parts and information is stored in microchips. Since there are no moving parts, reading/writing is much quicker. SSDs have other benefits: they are quieter, allow faster boot time (no ‘spin up’ time) and require less power (more battery life).</p>
<p>The read/write speed for a standard HDD is usually in the region of <span class="math">\(50-120\)</span>MB/s (usually closer to <span class="math">\(50\)</span>MB). For SSDs, speeds are typically over <span class="math">\(200\)</span>MB/s. For top-of-the-range models this can approach <span class="math">\(500\)</span>MB/s. If you’re wondering, read/write speeds for RAM is around <span class="math">\(2-20\)</span>GB/s. So at best SSDs are at least one order of magnitude slower than RAM, but still faster than standard HDDs.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Operating systems: 32-bit or 64-bit</h2>
<p>When we suggest that you should just buy more RAM, this assumes that you are using a <span class="math">\(64\)</span>-bit operating system. A <span class="math">\(32\)</span>-bit machine can access at most only <span class="math">\(4\)</span>GB of RAM. Although some CPUs offer solutions to this limitation, if you are running a <span class="math">\(32\)</span>-bit operating system, then R is limited to around <span class="math">\(3\)</span>GB RAM. If you are running a <span class="math">\(64\)</span>-bit operating system, but only a <span class="math">\(32\)</span>-bit version of R, then you have access to slightly more memory (but not much). Modern systems should run a <span class="math">\(64\)</span>-bit operating system, with a <span class="math">\(64\)</span>-bit version of R. Your memory limit is now measured as <span class="math">\(8\)</span> terabytes for Windows machines and <span class="math">\(128\)</span>TB for Unix-based OSs.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Central processing unit (CPU)</h2>
<p>The central processing unit (CPU), or the processor, is the brains of a computer. The CPU is responsible for performing numerical calculations. The faster the processor, the faster our code will run. The clock speed (or clock rate, measured in hertz) is frequency with which the CPU executes instructions. The faster the clock speed, the more instructions a CPU can execute in a section. CPU clock speed for a single CPU has been fairly static in the last couple of years, hovering around 3.4GHz (see figure 3.3).</p>
<p><img src="_main_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png" /><br /> Figure 3.3: CPU clock speed. The data for this figure was collected from web-forum and wikipedia. It is intended to indicate general trends in CPU speed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we can’t simply use clock speeds to compare CPUs, since the internal architecture of a CPU plays a crucial role in determining the CPU performance. The R package <code>benchmarkme</code> provides functions for benchmarking your system and contains data from previous benchmarks. Figure 3.4 shows the relative performance for eight different CPUs. All eight processors are Intel. The fastest processor in this benchmark study was the i7 CPU 870, which was released in 2009. In comparison, the Xeon Processor X3220, released in 2007, is over three times slower.</p>

<div id="cloud-computing" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Cloud computing</h2>
<p>Cloud computing uses networks of remote servers, instead of a local computer, to store and analyse data. It is now becoming increasingly popular to rent cloud computing resources.</p>
<div id="amazon-ec2" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.1</span> Amazon EC2</h3>
<p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is one of a number of providers of this service. EC2 makes it (relatively) easy to run R instances in the cloud. Users can configure the operating system, CPU, hard drive type, the amount of RAM and where your project is physically located.</p>
<p>If you want to run a server in the Amazon EC2 cloud, you have to select the system you are going to boot up. There are a vast array of pre-packaged system images. Some of these images are just basic operating systems, such as Debian or Ubuntu, which require further configuration. There is also an <a href="http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/">Amazon machine image</a> that specifically targets R and RStudio.</p>

<div id="exercise" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.6.2</span> Exercise</h3>
<p>To assess whether you should consider cloud computing, how much does it cost to rent a machine comparable to your laptop in the cloud?</p>
